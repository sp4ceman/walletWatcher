# walletWatcher
configure the wallets.json file with a name, your kraken details, and the amount you sent out to kraken (in rands).
will show you your kraken balances, how much you can buy on kraken, and how much that would sell for on luno (using last trade prices)
will also show final sale total, and profit percentage based on amount you sent out.

if it breaks, run it again, krakens prolly down.
if krakens up and it breaks, then fix it. and make a pull request.

##todo
work the kraken transfer costs into the equation
